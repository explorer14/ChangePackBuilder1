# ChangePackBuilder1

Legacy tool from back in the day when I was working without source control and I had to send code changes to a remote outsourcing company to merge with the main build. 
The idea behind this tool was that you set it monitoring your source folder and it keeps a track of all the files you are modifying. Once you are done with the changes, with just one click you can generate a change pack with a log.

Needless to say, you don't really need this tool anymore nevertheless it was a productivity tool that I could open source so did it.
